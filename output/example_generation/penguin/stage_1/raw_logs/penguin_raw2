After carefully examining the image and SVG code, I've identified the following visual problems:

1. The penguin's eyes are not visible, as they are the same color as the head.
2. The beak is too small and not easily distinguishable.
3. The feet are too small and barely visible.
4. The flippers appear disconnected from the body.
5. The belly shape doesn't blend well with the body, creating an unnatural silhouette.
6. The ice texture is barely noticeable and doesn't add much depth to the image.

To address these issues, I'll adjust the SVG code:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Ice sheet base -->
  <rect x="0" y="340" width="512" height="172" fill="#e6f3ff"/>
  <!-- Ice texture -->
  <polygon points="50,360 80,380 30,390" fill="#c6e0ff"/>
  <polygon points="200,370 230,390 180,400" fill="#c6e0ff"/>
  <polygon points="400,350 430,370 380,380" fill="#c6e0ff"/>
  <polygon points="100,400 150,420 70,430" fill="#c6e0ff"/>
  <polygon points="300,410 350,430 270,440" fill="#c6e0ff"/>
  <!-- Penguin body -->
  <ellipse cx="256" cy="266" rx="60" ry="80" fill="#000000"/>
  <!-- Penguin belly -->
  <ellipse cx="256" cy="286" rx="50" ry="70" fill="#ffffff"/>
  <!-- Penguin head -->
  <circle cx="256" cy="176" r="40" fill="#000000"/>
  <!-- Penguin beak -->
  <polygon points="241,196 256,216 271,196" fill="#ffa500"/>
  <!-- Penguin left flipper -->
  <polygon points="206,246 186,296 206,346" fill="#000000"/>
  <!-- Penguin right flipper -->
  <polygon points="306,246 326,296 306,346" fill="#000000"/>
  <!-- Penguin left foot -->
  <polygon points="221,356 251,356 236,376" fill="#ffa500"/>
  <!-- Penguin right foot -->
  <polygon points="261,356 291,356 276,376" fill="#ffa500"/>
  <!-- Penguin left eye -->
  <circle cx="241" cy="166" r="6" fill="#ffffff"/>
  <!-- Penguin right eye -->
  <circle cx="271" cy="166" r="6" fill="#ffffff"/>
</svg>
```

These adjustments address the identified issues:

1. Changed the eye color to white and increased their size for better visibility against the black head.
2. Enlarged and reshaped the beak to make it more prominent and recognizable.
3. Increased the size of the feet to make them more visible.
4. Adjusted the flipper positions to connect better with the body.
5. Slightly adjusted the belly shape to create a smoother silhouette.
6. Enhanced the ice texture by making the polygons larger and using a slightly darker shade of blue for better contrast.

These changes should result in a more visually accurate and recognizable penguin image while maintaining the overall simplistic style of the original.
