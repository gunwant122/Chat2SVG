After carefully examining the image and SVG code, I've identified the following visual problems:

1. Size: The apple appears too small within the viewbox.
2. Stem: The stem is too thin and barely visible.
3. Leaves: The leaves are not clearly distinguishable and appear more like green blobs.
4. Light reflection: The light reflection is too small and not very noticeable.
5. Color contrast: The red of the apple lacks depth and appears flat.

To address these issues, I'll adjust the SVG code:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Apple body -->
  <circle cx="256" cy="256" r="200" fill="#D50000"/>
  <!-- Apple highlight -->
  <circle cx="256" cy="256" r="180" fill="#FF1744"/>
  <!-- Light reflection -->
  <ellipse cx="176" cy="176" rx="40" ry="30" fill="#FFFFFF" opacity="0.7"/>
  <!-- Stem -->
  <rect x="252" y="56" width="8" height="40" fill="#4E342E"/>
  <!-- First leaf -->
  <path d="M240,76 Q220,56 200,76 Q220,96 240,76 Z" fill="#4CAF50"/>
  <!-- Second leaf -->
  <path d="M272,76 Q292,56 312,76 Q292,96 272,76 Z" fill="#4CAF50"/>
</svg>
```

These adjustments address the identified issues:

1. Increased the apple's size by doubling the radius to 200.
2. Made the stem wider and longer for better visibility.
3. Redesigned the leaves using more defined paths to make them look like actual leaves.
4. Enlarged the light reflection and made it slightly transparent for a more realistic look.
5. Added a darker red circle beneath the main apple color to create depth and a 3D effect.

These changes should result in a more visually appealing and recognizable apple image that better matches the expanded prompt.
