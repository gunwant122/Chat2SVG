After examining the image and SVG code, I've identified the following visual problems:

1. The apple shape is too perfect and lacks the characteristic indentation at the top.
2. The stem is too thin and short, making it barely visible.
3. The leaves are too small and simplistic, not resembling real apple leaves.
4. The light reflection is too large and opaque, making it look unnatural.
5. The apple's color is too bright and lacks depth.
6. The overall size of the apple is too large for the viewbox.

To address these issues, I'll adjust the SVG code:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Apple body with indentation -->
  <path d="M256,86 C150,86 66,170 66,276 C66,382 150,466 256,466 C362,466 446,382 446,276 C446,170 362,86 256,86 Q256,56 286,86" fill="#D32F2F"/>
  <!-- Apple highlight for depth -->
  <path d="M256,106 C160,106 86,180 86,276 C86,372 160,446 256,446 C352,446 426,372 426,276 C426,180 352,106 256,106 Q256,76 286,106" fill="#F44336"/>
  <!-- Light reflection -->
  <ellipse cx="186" cy="186" rx="30" ry="20" fill="#FFFFFF" opacity="0.5"/>
  <!-- Stem -->
  <rect x="252" y="66" width="8" height="30" fill="#3E2723"/>
  <!-- First leaf -->
  <path d="M240,86 Q220,66 200,86 Q220,106 240,86 Z" fill="#4CAF50"/>
  <!-- Second leaf -->
  <path d="M272,86 Q292,66 312,86 Q292,106 272,86 Z" fill="#4CAF50"/>
</svg>
```

These adjustments address the identified issues:

1. Used a path for the apple body to create a slight indentation at the top.
2. Made the stem wider and longer for better visibility.
3. Enlarged and reshaped the leaves for a more realistic appearance.
4. Reduced the size of the light reflection and made it semi-transparent.
5. Used two shades of red to add depth to the apple's color.
6. Slightly reduced the overall size of the apple to fit better within the viewbox.

These changes should result in a more realistic and visually appealing apple image that better matches the expanded prompt while maintaining all the original elements.
