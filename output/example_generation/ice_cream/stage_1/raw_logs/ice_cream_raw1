After examining the image and SVG code, I've identified the following visual problems:

1. Misalignment: The ice cream scoops are not properly aligned with the cone. They appear to be floating above the cone rather than sitting on it.
2. Disproportionate scaling: The ice cream cone appears too small in relation to the scoops.
3. Color contrast: The vanilla (top) scoop is very light and may not be easily visible against a white background.
4. Shape inconsistency: The cone is a simple triangle, which doesn't accurately represent the texture or shape of a waffle cone.

To address these issues, I'll adjust the SVG code. Here's the corrected version:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Ice cream cone -->
  <polygon points="256,460 186,260 326,260" fill="#D2691E"/>
  <!-- Cone texture lines -->
  <polyline points="206,310 306,310" fill="none" stroke="#A0522D" stroke-width="2"/>
  <polyline points="216,360 296,360" fill="none" stroke="#A0522D" stroke-width="2"/>
  <polyline points="226,410 286,410" fill="none" stroke="#A0522D" stroke-width="2"/>
  <!-- Bottom strawberry scoop -->
  <circle cx="256" cy="230" r="70" fill="#FFB6C1"/>
  <!-- Middle chocolate scoop -->
  <circle cx="256" cy="150" r="65" fill="#8B4513"/>
  <!-- Top vanilla scoop -->
  <circle cx="256" cy="80" r="60" fill="#F5DEB3"/>
</svg>
```

These adjustments address the identified issues:

1. The ice cream scoops have been repositioned to better align with the cone.
2. The cone has been enlarged and elongated to better match the proportion of the scoops.
3. The vanilla scoop's color has been changed to a darker shade (wheat) for better visibility.
4. Simple texture lines have been added to the cone to suggest a waffle pattern.

These changes should result in a more visually coherent and realistic ice cream cone image.
